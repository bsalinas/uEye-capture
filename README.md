uEye-capture
============
`uEye-capture` is a small c program for capturing still images from the [uEye usb cameras](http://en.ids-imaging.com/store/produkte/kameras/usb-2-0-kameras/ueye-se.html). These are rebranded and [sold by Thorlabs](http://www.thorlabs.de/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2916), and it is one of these cameras that I have and use this program with.

Usage
=====
`capture`
---------
The main program, `capture` operates in two modes depending on whether a commandline argument is given.

* When invoked without arguments, the `capture` will take a still frame snapshot and save it to `snapshot.bmp`.
* When invoked with a port number as the only commandline argument, the `capture` programm will listen on the specified port for [`zmq`](http://zeromq.org/) connections.
 * When a string is received, `capture` will take a still frame snapshot, and attempt to save it to the file specified by the string. i.e. the string needs to be a valid system path.
 * Upon successfully saving the snapshot, the program responds with `ok`.
 * **Important**: `zmq` is not transport neutral, and you cannnot simply use something like `nc` to talk to the program in network mode. The supplied `client` program should be used intead.

When in network mode `capture` will exit if it receives `@exit`.
 
`bench`
-------
The `bench` program can be used to get a rought idea of how many frames per second can be saved. The program will time how long it takes do perform 100 snapshots and writing the results to `/dev/null`.
